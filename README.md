# acm

Templates and toolkit used for ACM-ICPC or programming contests alike.

To use, first set up your bash: 

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/lxc902/acm.git
echo "source ~/acm/.acm" >> ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bashrc
```

Then in each contest:

```
cd ~/acm
mkdir cf_round_123
cd cf_round_123
ta # This will create a.cc, same for b.cc, c.cc etc.
```

Happy Coding!


## Advice
You should read `templates.cc` contents carefully to make sure you understand them before use.
